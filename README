This is bascially developer information and it's far from finish.

Check home page first: http://code.google.com/p/w3btorrent/ 


To make everything work you need:
apache php5 php5-xmlrpc screen rtorrent crontab and remember to put:

LoadModule scgi_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_scgi.so
SCGIMount /RPC2 127.0.0.1:5000

.. in your apache CFG. The online software will tell you how to do it if it's missing in future commits.


initiziation is loaded in this order: CONFIG.php -> configCheck.inc.php -> init.inc.php 

CONFIG.php
global config file for w3btorrent, this file will override online configuration!


inc/configCheck.inc.php
Checks if the syntax in CONFIG.php is fulfilled. This means that the correct variables needs to be declared.
This is the file which checks the permissions of the config.xml-file.


inc/init.inc.php
Run initial stuff.

NEW STUFF
- should be in their own including-files and header files.
- should have security check at the start if required
- should have proper file description in top
